Hello folks

I'm Jo, I'm learning GitHub to be able to share this skill with library professionals and the patrons they serve.
I've been learning command line using powershell and have found it super useful for renaming and arranging documents.
I'm excited to see what else command line implementation of programs from places like github can do!
